QueryFlow – Pay‑Per‑Query Data Insights for AI Agents
1. One‑Liner
QueryFlow is a pay‑per‑query platform that allows AI agents to purchase data and insights in real time using the x402 payment protocol on Avalanche, with no monthly subscription and no account registration.

2. Problem Statement
AI agents and developers need access to data (crypto prices, market sentiment, on‑chain metrics, gaming/behavioral data), but:

They are forced into expensive monthly API subscriptions (e.g., $99+/month) even if usage is low.

They must create accounts, manage API keys, dashboards, and complex billing integrations.

There is no standard way to do AI‑to‑AI / AI‑to‑API payments that is automatic, trustless, and settles within seconds.

In short: costs are high, UX is bad, and the system is not friendly to autonomous agents.

3. QueryFlow Solution (Core Product)
QueryFlow provides a “pay‑per‑query” API for data and insights that can be accessed directly by AI agents over HTTP + x402:

An agent sends an HTTP request to a QueryFlow endpoint (e.g., POST /insights/market).

The server responds with 402 Payment Required and a price quote (for example, $0.02 in USDC).

The agent pays using the x402 payment flow on Avalanche (settlement in around 2 seconds, optionally gasless for the user via a relayer).

Once the payment is valid, QueryFlow:

Fetches raw data from multiple sources (e.g., TURF Network for behavioral/gaming data, CoinGecko for crypto prices, DeFiLlama for DeFi metrics).

Processes the data with AI (OpenAI, Claude, or other models) into ready‑to‑use insights (summaries, risk scores, recommendations, etc.).

Returns the result to the agent as JSON or streaming text (SSE) for real‑time consumption.

The payment and query metadata are recorded:

On‑chain via QueryRegistry (user, query type, payment value, result hash).

Off‑chain in a database for analytics, rate limiting, and billing reports.

Core value: using data = pay once (pay‑per‑query), not a monthly subscription. AI agents can autonomously “buy” the information they need at any time, without humans and without creating new accounts.

4. Target Users
AI Trading Bots

Need real‑time prices, order book snapshots, on‑chain flows, and market sentiment for decision‑making.

Risk / Fraud Detection Agents

Need suspicious transaction patterns, risk scores, and aggregated on‑chain/off‑chain anomaly data.

Research / Recommender Agents

Need market indicators, statistics, correlations, and aggregated news/social sentiment.

Developers & Data Providers

Want to monetize their data or services without building billing and payments from scratch; they plug into QueryFlow and earn through revenue sharing.

5. Business Value (How QueryFlow Makes Money)
Primary revenue model: per‑query fee

Base price per request, for example:

Lightweight insights (simple sentiment, spot price): $0.01–$0.03

Heavier insights (multi‑source, on‑chain + off‑chain analytics): $0.05–$0.10+

Platform revenue:

A platform fee on each query (e.g., 10–20%).

The remainder is shared with data providers (automatic revenue sharing).

Future expansions:

Enterprise tier

Higher rate limits, private endpoints, SLAs, and dedicated support.

Private / premium feeds

Special data (institutional, long history, exclusive partner feeds) with higher pricing.

Agent marketplace

Agents can sell their own insights via QueryFlow (agent‑to‑agent commerce), still settled through x402.

6. Why It Fits the Hackathon (Payments x402)
Uses x402 as the native payment rail for:

AI‑to‑API payments: agent → QueryFlow.

AI‑to‑AI payments (future extension): agent → agent (via AgentRegistry + x402).

Leverages Avalanche as the base chain for:

Fast, low‑cost settlement (USDC on Fuji/Mainnet).

On‑chain registries (QueryRegistry, AgentRegistry) that provide transparency and verifiability.

Integrates naturally with ecosystem partners:

TURF Network as a data orchestration layer for gaming/behavioral and real‑time feeds.

Kite AI for agent identity and delegation (user → agent → session).

Thirdweb / x402 starter kits for payment flow implementation and wallet UX.

Aligns with the hackathon tracks:

Direct hit on “Data‑Powered AI for Payments” – data and AI drive decisions, while x402 powers the payments.

Also relevant to Tooling & Infrastructure as QueryFlow becomes data payment infrastructure for AI agents and developers.
