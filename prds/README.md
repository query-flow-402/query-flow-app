# PRD System - QueryFlow

**Simple, scannable rules for AI agents.**

## Files

- `rules.md` - Core rules (tech, style, commands)
- `component-slicing.md` - When/how to split components
- `api-design.md` - API endpoint patterns
- `contract-patterns.md` - Solidity conventions
- `examples/` - Code examples (optional)

## Usage

**Prompt agents with:**

Read prds/rules.md and prds/component-slicing.md

Build PaymentForm component:

Amount input

Wallet connect button

Submit button

Follow all rules.

text

**That's it.** Short, focused, actionable.

## Key Principle

**One file = One concern**

Don't make agents read everything. Point them to 1-2 relevant files only.
